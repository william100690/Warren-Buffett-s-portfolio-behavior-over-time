# Warren Buffett's portfolio performance over time

The objective of this project is to analyze in which type of companies Berkshire Hathaway has invested in order to find out in which industries it has shown interest and in which ones it has stopped participating.

For this project, we will use different Python tools to extract, transform, and load data (ETL), and Tableau software to create visualizations.
